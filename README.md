# Shell Scripting Projects

This repository showcases a collection of projects/scripts that I've created during my journey of learning Linux & Bash.

## Hyper Commander

A bash script that covers fundamentals of Linux operating system and Bash programming language. It can:

-   Print the user and OS info.
-   List the files and directories.
-   Navigate through the directories.
-   Rename, delete files, and change permissions.
-   Find executables and run them.
